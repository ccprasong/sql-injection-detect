# Nested sub queries

‚óè Un-nest sub queries:   
 Rewriting nested queries as joins often leads to more efficient
execution and more effective optimization. In general, sub-query unnesting
is always done for correlated sub-queries with, at most, one table in
the FROM clause, which are used in ANY, ALL, and EXISTS predicates.
A uncorrelated sub-query, or a sub-query with more than one table in
the FROM clause, is flattened if it can be decided, based on the query
semantics, that the sub-query returns at most one row.
EX: SELECT * FROM SH.products p WHERE p.prod_id = (SELECT s.prod_id FROM SH.sales
s WHERE s.cust_id = 100996 AND s.quantity_sold = 1 ) can be rewritten as:
SELECT p.* FROM SH.products p, sales s WHERE p.prod_id = s.prod_id AND
s.cust_id = 100996 AND s.quantity_sold = 1
