# OR Usage

‚óè Consider using an IN predicate when querying an indexed column:   
The IN-list predicate can be exploited for indexed retrieval and also,
the optimizer can sort the IN-list to match the sort sequence of the index,
leading to more efficient retrieval. Note that the IN-list must contain only
constants, or values that are constant during one execution of the query block,
such as outer references.
EX: SELECT s.* FROM SH.sales s WHERE s.prod_id = 14 OR s.prod_id = 17
can be rewritten as:
SELECT s.* FROM SH.sales s WHERE s.prod_id IN (14, 17)
