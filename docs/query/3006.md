# ORDER BY RAND Usage

● Sorting by a nondeterministic expression (RAND()) means the sorting cannot benefit from an index:   
There is no index containing the values returned by the random function.
That’s the point of them being ran- dom: they are different and
unpredictable each time they're selected. This is a problem for the performance
of the query, because using an index is one of the best ways of speeding up
sorting. The consequence of not using an index is that the query result set
has to be sorted by the database using a slow table scan.
One technique that avoids sorting the table is to choose a random value
between 1 and the greatest primary key value.
Still another technique that avoids problems found in the preceding alternatives
is to count the rows in the data set and return a random number between 0 and
the count. Then use this number as an offset when querying the data set.
Some queries just cannot be optimized consider taking a different approach.
