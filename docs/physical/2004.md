# Too Many Indexes

     ‚óè Don't create too many indexes:
You benefit from an index only if you run queries that use that index.
There's no benefit to creating indexes that you don't use.
If you cover a database table with indexes, you incur a lot of overhead
with no assurance of payoff.
Consider dropping unnecessary indexes.
If an index provides all the columns we need, then we don't need to read
rows of data from the table at all. Consider using such covering indexes.
Know your data, know your queries, and maintain the right set of indexes.
