# Imprecise Data Type

‚óè Use precise data types:   
Virtually any use of FLOAT, REAL, or DOUBLE PRECISION data types is suspect.
Most applications that use floating-point numbers don't require the range of
values supported by IEEE 754 formats. The cumulative impact of inexact 
floating-point numbers is severe when calculating aggregates.
Instead of FLOAT or its siblings, use the NUMERIC or DECIMAL SQL data types
for fixed-precision fractional numbers. These data types store numeric values
exactly, up to the precision you specify in the column definition.
Do not use FLOAT if you can avoid it.
