# Files Are Not SQL Data Types

     ‚óè Resources outside the database are not managed by the database:

store files external to the database.
Files don't obey DELETE, transaction isolation, rollback, or work well with
database backup tools. They do not obey SQL access privileges and are not SQL
data types.
Resources outside the database are not managed by the database.
You should consider storing blobs inside the database instead of in
external files. You can save the contents of a BLOB column to a file.
