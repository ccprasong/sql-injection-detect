# Generic Primary Key

 ## **Skip using a generic primary key (id):**   
  Adding an id column to every table causes several effects that make its
  use seem arbitrary. You might end up creating a redundant key or allow
  duplicate rows if you add this column in a compound key.
  The name id is so generic that it holds no meaning. This is especially
  important when you join two tables and they have the same primary
  key column name.
