# Foreign Key Does Not Exist

  ● **Consider adding a foreign key:**   
  Are you leaving out the application constraints? Even though it seems at
  first that skipping foreign key constraints makes your database design
  simpler, more flexible, or speedier, you pay for this in other ways.
  It becomes your responsibility to write code to ensure referential integrity
  manually. Use foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity.
  Foreign keys have another feature you can’t mimic using application code:
  cascading updates to multiple tables. This feature allows you to
  update or delete the parent row and lets the database takes care of any child
  rows that reference it. The way you declare the ON UPDATE or ON DELETE clauses
  in the foreign key constraint allow you to control the result of a cascading
  operation. Make your database mistake-proof with constraints.
