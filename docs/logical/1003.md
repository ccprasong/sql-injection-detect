# Primary Key Does Not Exist

  ● **Consider adding a primary key:**      
  A primary key constraint is important when you need to do the following:
  prevent a table from containing duplicate rows,
  reference individual rows in queries, and
  support foreign key references
  If you don’t use primary key constraints, you create a chore for yourself:
  checking for duplicate rows. More often than not, you will need to define
  a primary key for every table. Use compound keys when they are appropriate.
