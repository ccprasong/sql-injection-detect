‚óè Store each value in its own column and row:\n

Storing a list of IDs as a VARCHAR/TEXT column can cause performance and data integrity\n
problems. Querying against such a column would require using pattern-matching\n
expressions. It is awkward and costly to join a comma-separated list to matching rows.\n
This will make it harder to validate IDs. Think about what is the greatest number of\n
entries this list must support? Instead of using a multi-valued attribute,\n
consider storing it in a separate table, so that each individual value of that attribute\n
occupies a separate row. Such an intersection table implements a many-to-many relationship\n
between the two referenced tables. This will greatly simplify querying and validating\n
the IDs.\n;
